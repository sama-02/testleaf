1.What is oops stands for?
-OOPS-stands for object oriented programming language
2.What is Polymorphism? explain types?
-Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms.
-So polymorphism means many forms.
-There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism
3.what is interface and example in selenium,java?
-Selenium WebDriver is an interface that defines a set of methods.
-However, implementation is provided by the browser specific classes. 
-Some of the implementation classes are AndroidDriver , ChromeDriver , FirefoxDriver , InternetExplorerDriver , IPhoneDriver , SafariDriver etc.
4.what is abstarct class and example?
-Abstract classes are essential to providing an abstraction to the code to make it reusable and extendable.
-For example, a Vehicle parent class with Truck and Motorbike inheriting from it is an abstraction that easily allows more vehicles to be added.
5.Difference between multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance
-The key difference between Multiple and Multilevel Inheritance is that Multiple Inheritance is when a class inherits from many base classes 
while Multilevel Inheritance is when a class inherits from a derived class making that derived class a base class for a new class.
6.Is multiple inheritance possible in java?
-The Java programming language supports multiple inheritance of type, which is the ability of a class to implement more than one interface.
-An object can have multiple types: the type of its own class and the types of all the interfaces that the class implements.
7.What is keyword for using inheritance  
-The extends keyword extends a class (indicates that a class is inherited from another class).
8.what is the keyword to connect interface and class
The interface keyword is used to declare a special type of class that only contains abstract methods. 
To access the interface methods, the interface must be "implemented" (kinda like inherited) by another class with the implements keyword (instead of extends ).
9.what is difference between class and interface
-A class describes the attributes and behaviors of an object.
-An interface contains behaviors that a class implements. 
-A class may contain abstract methods, concrete methods.
-An interface contains only abstract methods
10.what is difference between class and abstract class
-Abstract methods cannot have body.
-Abstract class can have static fields and static method, like other classes.
-An abstract class cannot be declared as final.
